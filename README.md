# SimpleGameAlgorithm
This is a small Python project using scikit-learn libraries. Data is extracted from a .csv file, pre-processed, and analyzed using 3 different algorithm models: Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and Random Forest. Additional methods are used to display graphics to help display trends in the data.
